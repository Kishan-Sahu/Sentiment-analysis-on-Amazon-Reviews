0,Akash peelwa,Redmi Note 9 Pro ,"PLZZ read this complete information before buying from AmazonThey do not refund if your product got defected.Amazon is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy from Flipkart then go there. Don't waste your time on AmazonRegarding mobileWorst mobile i have ever seenBattery charging time is more than expected.Battery drainaing problem is thereCamera will stuck when you click pictures.Poor camera quality they said 48 mp but it's like 12mp.  If you are game lover then PLZZ try another mobile. Performance is very low.I told Amazon customer care to take this product back but they are not helping me instead they want me to go service center in covid19 situation which is in red zone. They can't provide home visit because their technician life is more important than customer. If customer get infected it's ok for them.Thanks Amazon for this service now i hate Amazon more than tiktok.Unistalling the app right now. And also recommending my friend's and relatives to not buy anything from Amazon, they are worst."

2,Sayantan Dey,Redmi Note 9 Pro ,Nice product in this price... Good quality and look is aswm... Punch hole Camera and display is very attracting. Camera is also perfect and battery capacity is very high. This phone is no doubt very much good.
3,Janvhi J.,Redmi Note 9 Pro ,"Hi all,As I have bought redmi note 9 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.I would give  you my honest experience..I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons  of this phone,1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 2 hrs.2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.6.sound is average,So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days. I really feel disappointed.( In battery, camera, display, Sound)Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.Thanks üëç"
4,VINOD SOMVANSHI,Redmi Note 9 Pro ,"Don't go for this mobile as I face issue with network signal after 2days only and I tried call to customer care of amazone they said me it's issue with your sim card but as I ask my sim card customer care they said it's new updated sim card and and i have issue with both sim card which has different network then how both sim has issue in same time, every time costomer care give me some reason to do this that but yes in my mobile I feel it has some issue because of that it's network gone for more than hour and also it hang in between gaming and use as it has 6gb ram and good processor."

19,Aman Singh,Redmi Note 8 ,"Redmi has been a prominent smartphone brand which has given a quality product at a pocket-friendly price range. I have a lot of expectation from Xiaomi. I have used almost 4 of their smartphone in last 2 Years but truely disappointed with Note 8.I Won't use the complex word & would like to make the review very simple & to the point.The Negative things of Redmi Note 8 are:-(1) üòî Battery drains very fast if you're using Wifi, low signal area & of course while gaming like PUBG & COD. Needs to recharge after 6-8 hours. But 18W Fast charging will help you to charge quickly but that doesn't solve the entire problem. (2) üò° Can't disable pre-installed apps. Lots of annoying ads & Can't give these phone to someone new to android or smartphone (eg. Parents because of unnecessary ads & you need to be very careful to handle them). (4) üí• Flashlight very poor ( Note 5 Pro, A3 & Note 8 Pro has better flash). (5) üëÄ Unnecessarily forces to use location in all apps (which is most annoying). Why is Mi so much interested in our location? (6) üì∑ The Quad camera works fine but zoom doesn't make much difference. Good for normal use & Justify the price segment. (7) ü§Æ Everyone tries to make UI & Design as simple to operate but Xiaomi MiUi is so disgusting & difficult to operate. (8) ü§ï Apps crash here and there. I hope they will consider this in upcoming updates.(9) üî• Heating issue while charging the phone & while using it for even 30 minutes.‚ö´ Overall: It is a nice phone for average use but if you're amazed by its so-called features & you think that it can survive your high-end requirement then be aware it is not for you."
20,Rinse John,OnePlus 7T Pro ,"==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ====I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below.OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro.===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ====+ Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus.+ Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance.+ Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T.+ Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology.+ Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro)+ Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well.==== What's in the Box? ====OnePlus 7T Pro Device.User Manual.Transparent Silicon Case.SIM Ejector Tool.Warp 30T Charging Brick.Type C USB Cable.And some cool OnePlus Stickers.==== Display ====Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this.==== Performance ====Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday.==== Camera ====I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too.==== Video ====If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro.==== Software ====This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android.==== Battery ====Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage.==== What could've been improved ====- Minor improvements on Camera.- No ToF sensor- No Wireless Charging.- IP Rating.- Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades.==== Verdict ====No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box.If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck.If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there."
21,BunnyDecoder,OnePlus 7T Pro ,"I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM.I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this:1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays.2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect.3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom.4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast.5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight.The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it.Go for it guys !! You won't regret."
22,Suhrid Bansal,OnePlus 7T Pro ,"Its fastest phone that I have ever experienced. There are no hiccups, none what so ever. Overall smooth experience between switching apps and regular functions.The Display is to die for.Magnificent Macro mode and Night mode  in camera.There is just nothing wrong with it.Overall an overwhelming experience.Call of Duty runs flawlessly ...The phone is so fast it takes some getting used to.Charging speed as advertised.No Complaints."
23,@bhi,OnePlus 7T Pro ,"Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA.The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM.NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POORIN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP.IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR.THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY.SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY.Hope ONE PLUS Team look and work on it and solve this issue in his next software updates.Dear Amazon team pass this feedback to ONE PLUS TEAM."
24,Abirami,OnePlus 7T Pro ,"Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display.I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought.Highlights:1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it.2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes.  *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks.  Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots.  Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles.  Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime.  Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models.4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays.5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat. Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming.6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate."
25,Biswamber Hojai,OnePlus 7T Pro ,One of the best Oneplus phone ever. Superb Amazon üëçüèª One plus 7T pro is far better then iphone 11.
26,Sahil Garg,OnePlus 7T Pro ,"I was really happy to have this phone, switching from apple to android. The phone is really big and has lot of power in it, no problem in playing games, its like silk smooth games, navigation between apps, super fast. All updates were done for software and apps. I am in love with it.... ButAfter 2 days of normal usage and random navigation on the device. The device started rebooting itself, I was shocked but thought maybe just after reboot it will ok. But it rebooted for 3 hours continuously without any stop, till the whole battery got drained. I was not able to perform any action, it made me handicapped for 3 hours, where I cannot do anything... Check the videoFinally, I am returning it after long conversation with Amazon support and the OnePlus team.Buy at your own Risk..!!!"
27,Pradeep Singh Bisht,OnePlus 7T Pro ,i bought one plus 7T pro on  last Tuesday i.e. 22/10/19 and with in one week it is started some software and hardware problem. phone is not working well and heating problem also with the mobile. i call customer care executing they are not treating well. waste of money product. please don't buy it from this seller.
28,Astik ,OnePlus 7T Pro ,Phone is great. Everything is good.But I have one doubt. I got acko screen protection for 1 year.But Amazon didn't mention about this acko screen protection offer.Do anyone got too?
29,AmazonCustomer,OnePlus 7T Pro ,"No 3.5 headphone jack(Phone is thicker than 3.5 and there's plenty of space). No 3.5/C adapter provided in box. Never settle? No official adapter sold in Amazon either. You have to get registered on their website. Why?!Display seems to have a bit of yellow tint. Although fast, not really seeing the so called magic of 90Hz display. Overhyped. Curved edges make reading a bit weird: Lines go up from the left (curve on the left), then flat in the middle and then go down on the right(curve on the right)- Wish the OS provided a margin on both edges,if needed."
30,jaywant,Apple iPhone 7 ,"i received defective iphone 7 32GB silver colour during ""Great Indian Festival Sale 2018"".Amazon delivered the product in a Day.But Product seems to be non functional. as Rear camera get Freeze due to faulty camera sensor. Just to save the time & money, i bought it from Amazon online E-store. Now Amazon representative, asked me to visit Apple Service store. So far i have wasted my precious time & my mind . The phone was sold by ""Sold by Appario Retail Private Ltd "" .I'm really fed up till now. expecting Amazon to do quick action against it."
31,Utpal Das,Apple iPhone 7 ,"Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India"
32,Bharath Kumar,Apple iPhone 7 ,Thanks for Amazon service. phone is very nice and cool also is the display was very very cool the sound clarity is excellent and phone is very slim. And the processor is very fast Nice performance in gaming. Compare to other phones this is superb.
33,Deepika,Apple iPhone 7 ,My phone is not working since it has been arrived. Complain done atlest 10 times with the customer care but no positive response. I think i am wasted mine 38k. Amazon is a brand but still no response even they are constinusly saying that we cant do anything in this situation. VERY DISSAPOINETD THIS TIME.
34,Rishabh,Apple iPhone 7 ,If you are an apple fan !! This is a true beauty to go for !!
35,Keshav Singh,Apple iPhone 7 ,"First of all one would want to know is the product genuine and not refurbished coz during Amazon Big Sale I got it for 35k.Before unboxing the I checked up at Apple website and Online check with serial no , EMEI no and other detailsAnd it was 100% genuine and new Handset.Phone is working greatDelivery was also quick in 03 days .."
36,Vikram Nayak ,Apple iPhone 7 ,"Very good specs which can handle updates for next 4 yrs .Good phone for people who don't use power hungry apps for long durations ,camera definitely upto the mark"
37,Lalit A.,Apple iPhone 7 ,This iPhone7 is in hearing problems. What Can I do
38,J Balaji,Apple iPhone 7 ,"Exactly after one year 1 week the ear piece ddnt work. when i went to the store they asked me 35k for replacement. useless phones. for the premium price tag of 55-60K the phones dont even work for 1 year. I had 5s, 6 Plus and this 7. All had same type of problems and the phone went into trouble exactly after warranty.Useless.These big companies take india and indians for a ride.I would never buy any apple products for sure."
39,Mandeep B.,Apple iPhone 7 ,"Coming from oneplus 3, this phone has been a great upgrade. Always wanted to know why the iOS is so popular. Well it is because it never disappoints. I am writing this review one year after purchasing it and it works like a charm. Still. I don‚Äôt feel the need to upgrade to some other device (iphone 8, x or xs) because it works flawlessly without any lag or delay whatsoever. The camera is great.The only problem is the battery life which isn‚Äôt enough for a complete day."
40,Dushantha B.E,Vivo V17 ,Super vivo v17
41,G.V.S.Swaroop,Vivo V17 ,"I'm a very generic user mainly using the phone for calling, clicking pics, watch movies and some apps like whatsapp, Twitter, travel booking and mails and meetings. Received the phone today and the first impression is that the phone feels light for its size, display is awesome, receptive and very smooth. Camera clicks some really good pictures and when clicked in 48MP mode, the clarity sustains even after zooming in. The charging is also pretty fast. I hope the battery life is also good. Overall, it seems a superb phone at this price point."
42,DINESHKUMAR,Vivo V17 ,Camera average performance only night mode camera not satisfied very dark pictures it's taking..I didn't expect this fr Vivo.Battery display excellent.camera not good..Worst night mode camera.other things sounds good..
43,Ravi R.,Vivo V17 ,"Wow... As expected main camera is awesome... it's a camera centric phone so don't go for the processor it's actually runs well with Snapdragon 675with 8GB RAM and I swear display, camera, and battery is awesome...even having 4500mah battery it's very light weight.... Over all it's perfect phone for me...Go for it if you're looking for a phone with good camera, display and battery... U'll not regret... Happy customer...Thanks to Amazon for quick delivery..."
44,MD NAIM BAGWAN,Vivo V17 ,good  best product
45,Neerbhay rai,Vivo V17 ,Very bad.please don't buy any one there is no return policy.. hurting from vivo..
46,Jack,Vivo V17 ,"This product is waste it's better to go for mi or oppo or Samsung any other brand, I have used almost all brands but vivo is the worst one, it will take time to load anything you can sense it like it's lagging for example,when you open browser then it starts lagging to load the page and if you open anyone's dp in WhatsApp there also you can sense it and most important one if we are on call then you will get ear pains and headache, and I called for Amazon guys they are very worst, when I kept for replacement then they are telling these are common thing in this brand, what ever the issue if you tell them they will tell simply it's common in this brand.. the one thing little bit good is cam nothing else even it's 8gb ram it works like 2 GB ram worst phone ever I used and worst guys from Amazon, try to take it from Flipkart"
47,Ramesh,Vivo V17 ,"This Product is very good in all aspects, but the price is little higher as the processor relatively old.Camera Quality is goodBattery Life is goodSound Quality is normal.Processor relatively oldSince  the Processor relatively old, the Price would have kept between 17K to 19K."
48,Hari   TOP 100 REVIEWER,Vivo V17 ,"Huge expectation from Vivo. But all in vainThe device had board issue and customer care tried to cheat me by asking to pay refundable deposit for board replacement, although under warranty.The device had serious flaws and 2 software updates couldn't rectify them.Vivo customer care asked me to take the device to service center.Nowadays service centres are run by gangs and they demand money in pretext of refundable deposit and then once the repair is complete, they deny to pay it.If you start a fight, in no time you will be removed from store. There are people ready to trash you up in nearby stores.Huge problem in India, as gadgets are becoming more and more common, people are looted by thugs in various ways."
49,Mohd Asadali Kalimuddin shaikh,Vivo V17 ,First look and I can't get eyes of the phone.. I don't know how many hours continuous I'm gonna play with this beauty and masterpieceI got many suggestion not to buy this but I thought to take a risk and it worth it amazing sleek and punchy colors...
50,ashish,OnePlus 8 5G ,"Hell man! Im a oneplus fan till i buy this mobile,Camera of this phone is completely worse before i was using oneplus 6 ,op6 camera is much better when compared with op8.....and important point to note that this phone does not even compete with my moms phone samsung a50s which is 15k rs phone.Lastly if you dont trust reviews on this,Kindly reach me out atI will provide you the originals pictures,because i have wasted 40k ...not let you guys to wasteNote: i have seen all reviews in youtube,but all will say it is bit bad .....but it is completely bad."
51,Manpreet Singh,OnePlus 8 5G ,"I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive!Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung.I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too.My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices.1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely.2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well.3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ).4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good.5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not.I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display.It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this.Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes.OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5."

Meena üê∫,OnePlus 8 5G ,"Great phone!Gaming performance is so great, device don't get heat up at all even at high settings!I played PUBG Mobile and details it provides were so exciting and make it feel real. Shadows of tree,stones, mud, etc. If you have small hands don't buy it for gaming, don't feel comfortable with small hands.Camera is good, can't say it is awesome!Battery life is great too, charge too fast!UI is as expected stock android, some pre-installed third party apps were also installed, you can uninstall all of them except Netflix.The back cover they provide is loose and cheap. Have to buy a new better one!Over all a great phone!Cheers! :)"
53,Rahul,OnePlus 8 5G ,On the first glance you will feel the premium quality of the Oneplus 8.I have mentioned few good and bad points for quick understanding for every buyer -Good -Very good build qualityVivid displayExcellent performance and softwareSolid battery lifeDecent camera performanceChic designConsistent performanceOxygen OS is blissClass-leading displayBad-No IP rating or wireless chargingLow-light video could be betterBasic cameras setup
54,Aparna Uniyal,OnePlus 8 5G ,"I have bought one plus 8 just 3 days back and now i am facing multiple issues like battery backup i am getting for just 3-4 hours of screen on time also facing issues with mobile hotspot as when i am connecting it with my laptop its getting reconnecting again and again however when i am conneting another device hotspot with the same network its working also its getting heat every time often i use lite application like facebook whtsapp no have apps or games are there i have tried to contact one plus support on call, whtsapp and chat but there is no response from there side"
55,shaikh,OnePlus 8 5G ,Camera quality is worst than OnePlus 6T
56,Abhishek Patnaik,OnePlus 8 5G ,Badly Heating Issue
57,Sahil bansal,OnePlus 8 5G ,"Great phone, Amazon delivers it within 10 hours of ordering really happy there,Pros: Beast performanceGreat battery LifeBrilliant ScreenFluid 90hzAnd blazing fast oxygen os5gCons:Camera: have a 2megapixel camera for the sake of having 3 camera on the backRest of the camera are only averageHopefully upadates can fix that and given one plus history I think they will!Curved screen cause accidental touches and most covers can't cover phone fully in the front due to display Hence its prone to break more than regular flat screen phone like 7tHave a little bit of weight due to larger batteryPrincing is highly agressive but could have provided wireless charging and headphone jackIn the same price!Overall good phone if you want a future proof phone but this eyes closedBut if you are on a budget 7t can mostly get you there with better camera and almost as fast snapdragon 855plusChoose wisely"
58,SK,OnePlus 8 5G ,"Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get.Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money.Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision. Cant go wrong - Just buy the damn thing!"
59,Swapnil Bhadale,OnePlus 8 5G ,With 3.5 mm jack adapter phone not giving any sound I tested many earphones but it does not work shame on you Oneplus
60,Arjun,OPPO A53 ,Super phone have to buy phone nice
61,Sunita Rani,OPPO A53 ,"NEVER BUY OPPO. This phone is just a wastage of money, if you are going to buy this phone then change your decision because it will not provide cost on which you will buy it. You should buy SAMSUNG GALAXY M21 instead of going with any other brand phone in the budget segment under 15k. You will get best performance, camera, battery, display, overall everything better than oppo. Nothing new in oppo a53 other than 90 Hz refresh rate. Oppo never provide value for money product."
62,Shyochanda Puri,OPPO A53 ,Earphones not received in headset box .....
63,Arvind singh,OPPO A53 ,Very poor back  camera....should not buy if u looking for good camera
64,Vivek,OPPO A53 ,"Really happy to own this wonderful phone. It has powerful processor and I can easily play all games and listen to my favorite music without any lag. Excellent Battery life too. My earlier phone needed charging twice a day but with this I don't need a charger in my car, office and home. Value for money. A must buy in this price segment."

78,Shanti Swaroop Chinnapaka,Vivo Y20 ,"Disappointed totally with camera and display. watching youtube videos was pathetic. Rest of the features are ok.4GB/64GB, 5000mah, side finger print are the saving grace.

80,Dahiya_Boy,Panasonic Eluga I8 ,"Panasonic Eluga I8 is an average phone. I have great expectation from this India brand but I must say chinese products spcly MI/XIOMI gives far much better quality in this price.1. Phone does not support HD. Youtube video max resolution is 480p,and same video is 1080p. Same video quality check from Amazon Prime Video.2. Tried to download the image for wallpaper from Google Chrome. System automatically converts the HD image into low level.3. Captured images are also not good as expected with 13px camera. Front camera even worst. If light is dim then there are chances you have been looked like ghost in front camera. Plus beauty feature is useless.4. Every ringtone is annoying.5. Android 10 was released in Sept 2019 and now its June 2020 end still there is not update.Should I buy this product.Well, right now its lock-down and lots of options are not available so purchased this mobile for my mom. Its fine for her as because all she need to watch youtube video, forwarding some GM pics to relatives and call talk.BTW, on warranty card its written 24 months device (including battery) warranty period but its mentioned 12 months in amazon product description while accessory warranty period is still 6 months. Hope company follows warranty card  description. Check image with highlighted portion for this point"
81,Vivek g.,Panasonic Eluga I8 ,Nice mobile at its features..price is little bit high..but overall mobile is best for old age peoples..not for gaming..and amazon has specified wrong battery capacity..its battery is 4000 Mah..
82,Dilsoft,Panasonic Eluga I8 ,"Beautiful size with many goodeis. Great speed (thanks to its octa core processor), decent camera and nice screen size.  Can't expect more than this from a below 10K phone."
83,roli,Panasonic Eluga I8 ,I received a defective product. I ordered this as gift to my aunt. The product package had a hole when it was received  and there was a blast when the mobile was put to charging for the first time. It could have been fatal for people around. I need proper justification and action for this.
84,Saswat,Panasonic Eluga I8 ,Excellent phone should go with itIt's just amazing and display quality improved. I am using this phone for past 15 days it's quality is A1 and yeah price little high but product is excellent. For gaming experience I downloaded pubg it works in high graphics and no lag I was really shocked seeing it and also gta worked properly so for gaming also it's good . Really should go for it in this situation of India. Let's buy Indian product and make India great in phones.Made in India Made for India . Love u Panasonic
85,PRANJUL MISHRA,Panasonic Eluga I8 ,"üëç After Using this for 5 Days (Heavy Usage), I am Reviewing this Phone.For the User Interface It is Stock Android. Built Quality is Good but Plastic from Back. Camera is Average, as expected. Design is classical but nothing new, Ok type. RAM of 3GB is providing a decent performance as of now, Multi-Tasking is fluent with zero issues at all. It is Ok with Gaming as well, No Lags or Heating (30-45 Mins). Battery backup is around 16+ Hours. You'll have to Charge it everyday. At the Price of 8.5K, You can't and won't get a better non-Chinese smartphone with these many features & this type of performance. Overall it is like an Average Allrounder in all specs. No Complaints as of Now, as expected. I would rate it Very Decent & Nice. For People with normal Usages, It is a Perfect Phone, Must Go for it. For People with Heavy Usages, Well, You have to think for it and then buy because for this Budget I don't think you can get anything significantly better. Overall a Full Marks achieverüëå. Delivery Speed & Packaging is as remarkable as always from Amazon."
86,Amit Kumar Garg,Panasonic Eluga I8 ,Go for it.

90,SAIF RAZA,Mi 10 ,All are okk but mobile heating problem so high.I suggest you guys plz don't buy this device.
91,nitin panwar,Mi 10 ,"Hi guys,In general the phone is nice and does manages to provide you the feeling of a premium phone. However there are some flaws which I witnessed over my experience till date. So let me provide you the Pros and Cons of the phone -PROS...1. Nice built quality and comfortable to hold.2. Excellent performance.3. Symmetric stereo speakers. (Better experience while watching videos or playing games)4. Nice camera with with very good quality low light or night photography which still many flagship phones lack.5. Up to the mark 90Hz refresh rate display.6. Amoled screen brightness is excellent and there is no issue in viewing display even while the display is directly facing towards the sun.7. Excellent charging with 30 watts wired and wireless charging. I tried charging the phone from dead 0 to 100 and achieved it just under 1 hour. (In my personal opinion I don't think higher charging wattage like 65 watts is good for phone battery and sounds like a gimmick as even though they have double the wattage they usually charge a phone of smaller battery about 4000 mAH in about 40 minutes which is not much of a difference. )8. Super steady video from rear camera because of presence of both EIS & OIS.9.Bigger battery 4780 mAH as compared to other flagship phones.10. Doesn't misses out on any feature like reverse wireless charging, 5g support (though in India not of use for at least couple of years), NFC, Dual GPS, capable of being connected to wifi and provide Hotspot simultaneously, No MIUI ads till date.CONS...1. The limitation of resolution of the screen FHD+. The bigger size of the screen results in lower ppi and thus stands nowhere near QHD+ displays.2. This phone comes with Global MIUI 11 and has Google dialer and messaging app thus misses out features like call recording, phone notes etc. (Reason being in many countries like UAE it is illegal to have call recording apps or VPN apps. )3. Trust me this MIUI has a lot of bugs and thus results in issues like while using finger print scanner, the device heats up at times even during normal usage, but the overall performance is acceptable. (Hopefully most of the issues will be resolved by MIUI 12 update which is going to be available soon)4. Outdated front camera and supporting rear cameras hardware. (The 20 MP front camera and that too without EIS, 2 MP macro camera, 2 MP depth camera and 13 MP ultrawide camera seems like a joke for a 2020 flagship phone with the price of 50k.)5. The battery is bigger compared to many devices but looses about 10 to 20% even when left untouched overnight thus I'd say not so good battery management.6. Misses out a 3.5 mm Jack and also the c type to 3.5 mm Jack converter provided in the box doesn't seem to be of a very good quality as per my initial impression.7. Though the low light photography is good but daylight photography is not that exceptional as one might expect from 108 MP camera.8. I felt that the call quality is not up to the mark. (Maybe just in my case)Pricing issues - Though there are two things which have gone against Xiaomi as well as other Mobile brands1) Increment in GST rates from 12% to 18%2) Higher import duties for imported phones.I think that the phone is slightly overpriced at 50k but if we compare it with it`s biggest competitor the One plus 8 I will always choose MI 10 as so many things are missing in One plus 8 (like wireless charging, LP DDR RAM 4x is present instead of 5, comes with smaller battery 4300mAH and Sony IMX 586 Camera sensor which is quite outdated now) and have a price difference of only 5k.  Even that can be narrowed down by using bank offers if available which was there in my case. However in comparison with One plus 8 pro I feel that MI 10 is slightly behind because of the MIUI bugs related flaws, FHD+ display and outdated secondary camera hardware (including front camera. Thus I believe that if the aforementioned issues would have been addressed by Xiaomi I would have considered this phone justifying the price completely and without a doubt would have been the best phone ever under 50k. However in reality still the phone is definitely a strong competitor in the flagship mobile segment."
92,naveen,Mi 10 ,Heating problem.....waste of hard money....go for other phones in the same range......
